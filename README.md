## Introduction

A public space chat app developed on Android using Jetpack Compose and Kotlin. The app is based on the idea of having "Rooms" where people can chat and at any time join or leave the conversation. If not that, users can also create their own room and invite people to join them. Users can just search for any room name to join just to explore other rooms and see what's happening.

The application makes full use of Firebase authentication and facilitates real-time conversation using Firebase Realtime Database. The app is developed purely with Compose and no XML-based layout file is used.

Technologies used:
1. Kotlin
2. Android - Jetpack Compose
3. Firebase Authentication
4. Firebase Realtime Database
